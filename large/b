Life
can
be
defined
as
the
experience
between
birth
and
death,
or
can
be
defined
as
existence
itself,
nature,
the
universe,
or
quite
simply
as
everything
in
existence.
Life
is.
It
is
self
evident
through
experience.
Life
expresses
in
a
multitude
of
forms,
but
in
essence
is
as
an
interconnected
oneness.
This
oneness,
which
is
all
there
is,
exists
and
expresses
in
many
dimensions,
including
that
of
space
and
time.
Space
makes
it
possible
for
life
forms
to
exist
as
distinct
entities
in
relation
to
each
other,
evolving
though
the
interaction.
Within
the
realm
of
space
we
experience
physical
existence,
in
physical
bodies,
the
apparent
hub
of
all
our
physical,
mental,
emotional
and
spiritual
experiences.
The
dimension
of
time
makes
it
possible
to
experience
Life
as
a
series
of
distinct
events
occurring
in
a
sequential
nature.
This
enables
the
phenomena
of
experience,
growth
and
evolution.
While
it
may
seem
that
we
are
only
that
which
lives,
we
are
in
essence
life
itself.
And
while
it
may
seem
that
we
are
separate
from
each
other,
separate
from
the
universe
and
from
life
itself,
we
are
intrinsically
interconnected.
WE
ARE
ALL
ONE
–
not
as
a
mere
concept,
but
as
a
reality
beyond
our
realm
of
concepts,
beyond
the
divisive
mind.
Our
true
self,
the
innermost
you
and
me,
is
intimately
connected
with
the
infinite
consciousness
that
pervades
all
things
and
enables
all
experience.
From
this
consciousness
emerges
this
‘seeming
reality’
of
separation,
individuality,
limitation,
insufficiency
and
need
–
in
order
that
we
may
experience
ourselves
in
a
myriad
of
ways,
and
have
the
opportunity
to
create
and
re-create
ourselves
–
and
our
world
-continually
in
our
highest
ideas,
our
deepest
desires,
and
greatest
imaginings.
In
doing
so,
we
take
the
process
of
life
–
and
life
itself
–
to
the
next
level
of
being
and
expression
in
a
wondrous,
magnificent,
ever-evolving
reality.
In
the
process,
we
get
to
create
meaning
and
have
some
fun
along
the
way
